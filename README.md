# MachineLearning_IrisDataset_Jupiter_notebook
Machine Learning project done using Scikit Learn library. The data set is an IRIS flower data set consisting of Features of iris flowers and Result values based on three iris flowers. The data set is imported through KAGGLE and then split into Training set containing ( X: features , Y: target) and testing values. The supervised learning Classification modeling is performed by analyzing the data and K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR MODEL is applied to the dataset. The model is trained and then tested. The accuracy level is also evaluated by comparing the predicted values with the actual values of Y. The model tells that what type of iris flower is sampled by giving it set of feature values.
